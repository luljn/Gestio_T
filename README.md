# Project title

Gestio_T

## Description

This is a small program for managing processes(start an application, stop an application, see the list of running processes) on the Windows operating system from the cmd.

## To run the code.

I used DevC++ IDE to realize this small project, if you want to run the code by yourself, 
you can also use it or any other you want, you should create a new project in your IDE,
and add all the files with .hpp or .cpp extensions that are here. 

## The application.

I pushed the app with .exe extension (for windows) so you can directly try it.
